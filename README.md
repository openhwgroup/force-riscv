# Introduction to FORCE-RISCV

FORCE-RISCV is an instruction sequence generator (ISG) for the RISC-V instruction set architecture.  It can be used to generate tests for design verification of RISC-V processors.  FORCE-RISCV uses randomization to choose instructions, registers, addresses and data for the tests, and can generate valid test sequences with very little input from the user.  However, FORCE-RISCV provides a set of APIs with extensive capabilities which gives the user a high level of control over how the instruction generation takes place.

Test templates (written in Python) are used to control FORCE-RISCV instruction generation by invoking the FORCE-RISCV APIs to define constraints and specify the instructions.  Because the test templates are normal Python code, the user has the power of the Python programming language to define the instruction generation sequence and the appropriate constraints.

FORCE-RISCV is integrated with the Handcar instruction simulator to model the behavior of the generated RISC-V instructions.  Handcar is based on the Spike open source RISC-V instruction simulator.  The format for the generation output is the standard *.ELF file and a disassembled text *.S file.

FORCE-RISCV provides full support of the RISC-V ISA, including:
* RV64G - (RV64I, MAFDC).  (V extension support planned)
* RISC-V privileged ISA, including full support for the U, S, and M privilege levels.
* RISC-V traps and exceptions basic handling.
* Support for non-trivial exception handlers is planned.
* Full support for the v48 virtual memory systems, including 4KB, 2MB, 1GB and 512GB page sizes.

# FORCE-RISCV Quick Start Guide for RISC-V

## User Manual
The user manual is located in the 'force-riscv/doc' directory.  The user manual is still a "work in progress".
  *  FORCE-RISCV_ISG_User_Manual-v0.8.docx
  *  FORCE-RISCV_ISG_User_Manual-v0.8.pdf

## Use FORCE-RISCV to generate a RISC-V testcase (ELF file) from a FORCE-RISCV test template

### Setup
* Clone the FORCE-RISCV repository:
  * The \[base directory\] in the description that follows is the directory from which you execute git clone.
  * git clone http://path-to-the-repository/force-riscv.git
* Set the following environment variables.  FORCE-RISCV development requires gcc 5.1 or higher and Python 3.4.1 or higher version.
  * export FORCE_CC=/usr/bin/g++
  * export FORCE_PYTHON_VER=3.6
  * export FORCE_PYTHON_LIB=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
  * export FORCE_PYTHON_INC=/usr/include/python3.6
* Build FORCE-RISCV
  * cd \[base directory\]/force-riscv/
  * make                    
  * make tests
* Run the main regression while in the force-riscv directory
  * ./utils/regression/master_run.py
* Run the unit-tests regression while in the force-riscv directory
  *  ./utils/regression/unit_tests.py

### ELF file generation running FORCE-RISCV directly
FORCE-RISCV is run from the Linux/Unix command line, and you can specify command line options that alter how the test generation is run.  You can run this simple "smoke test" to demonstrate that the build was successful.
    bin/friscv -t utils/smoke/test_force.py
You can run FORCE-RISCV from any directory; just adjust the relative path names.  For example,
    cd force-riscv/tmp
    ../bin/friscv -t ../utils/smoke/test_force.py
Note that the file name of a FORCE-RISCV test template always ends with "_force.py"; this serves to indicate that the file is a Python script, and that it is a FORCE-RISCV test template.

The FORCE-RISCV program will generate the following files:
    <templateName>.Default.S
    <templateName>.Default.ELF
Which in our example is:
    test_force.Default.S
    test_force.Default.ELF
The *.ELF files can be the input to an RTL simulation environment defining what instructions get executed during the simulation.  The *.S files are assembly code style files to help the user see what instructions have been generated.

Generation can also be run with the master_run.py utility script.  Here is an example command line specifying a *_fctrl.py file.  The *_fctrl.py file contains the path to and name of the template file along with options that get passed to master_run and FORCE-RISCV.
    utils/regression/master_run.py -f examples/riscv/_def_fctrl.py -c utils/regression/config/_def_riscv_fcfg.py -k all
    
Notes on contents of the control file (*_fctrl.py):
    * "-cfg":"config/riscv.config" is required in the "generator" options for any generation for the RISC-V architecture.

For example:  <base directory>/force-riscv/tests/riscv/fsuExamples/fsu_basic_fctrl.py

        control_items = [
            { "fname":"basic_random_01_force.py",
              "options":{"max-instr":50000, "iterations":1),
              "generator":{"--cfg": "config/riscv.config", "--options": "\"MMU=1\""} } ]
    
    

Notes on contents of template file (*_force.py):

    An example of a simple FORCE-RISCV template file is at
    
        <base directory>/force-riscv/examples/riscv/basic_random_01_force.py
    
    The strings that represent each instruction in the ISA can be found in the file:
    
        <base directory>/force-riscv/py/DV/riscv/trees/instruction_tree.py
        
For more details on the FORCE-RISCV test template and the FORCE-RISCV API, refer to the FORCE-RISCV ISG User Manual.

Here are the contents of an example test template:

        from riscv.EnvRISCV import EnvRISCV
        from riscv.GenThreadRISCV import GenThreadRISCV
        from base.Sequence import Sequence
        
        class MainSequence(Sequence):
        
            def generate(self, **kargs):
                self.genInstruction("ADD##RISCV")
                self.genInstruction("SRA##RISCV")
        
        MainSequenceClass = MainSequence
        GenThreadClass = GenThreadRISCV
        EnvClass = EnvRISCV

This template generates an ADD instruction followed by an SRA instruction.  Addressing, register selection and register values are randomized and chosen by FORCE-RISCV automatically.
                


        
### Output files

The output files can be found in:

    <base directory>/force-riscv/output/regression/basic_random_01_force/00000
    where "basic_random_01_force" is the name of your template file (without the '.py' suffix).
    
Output Files | Brief Description
------------ | -----------------
fsu_basic_force_*.Default.ELF | The ELF file is a binary file that contains the generated test.  Typically, it is the input to the simulators.
fsu_basic_force_*.Default.S  | The *.S file is a text listing of the disassembled instruction stream and their associated memory addresses.  It can be used as a debug aid.
fpix_sim.log | A text file that contains the disassembled instruction stream, their associated memory addresses and the values of the architected registers as they are read and written in the execution of each instruction in the stream.  It can be used as a debug aid. It is the output of the execution that occurs after generation has been entirely completed.
gen.log | Detailed output from FORCE-RISCV regarding the generation process.
sim.log | A text file that contains the disassembled instruction stream as the instructions are being generated, along with the associated values of the registers and memory read and written by the instructions.  Similar to the fpix_sim.log but sim.log has some additional information and better formatting.

### The process to build handcar_cosim.so

The Handcar cosim shared object (utils/handcar/handcar_cosim.so) is implemented based on Spike ISS (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim).  We implemented additional code to package Spike code into a shared object with well-defined C APIs.  Since the build process is slightly involved, we have included a prebuilt handcar_cosim.so inside the utils/handcar directory.

The C header for the APIs can be found at: utils/handcar/handcar_cosim_wrapper.h

The exact command steps to build the handcar_cosim.so yourself are contained in this script: handcar/regenerate_and_build.bash

To build the handcar_cosim.so:

    cd handcar
    ./regenerate_and_build.bash

If the regenerate_and_build.bash script failed for some reason, it might be a good idea to execute the commands in there step-by-step.  We intend to improve this process and make it more robust down the road.

### Near term roadmap
* Finish support for paging exceptions and control
* Finish support for Vector extension version 0.9
* Fast exception handling
* Full machine mode switching support (currently from lower privileged mode to high privileged mode is not yet supported)
* Support for 32-bit RISC-V ISS and ISG (We hope there is some help coming in for this from the open source community)
